All scripts go under the "scripts" directory in the bot's working directory.

Currently, it'll try to load anything under that directory. Don't put 
stuff that isn't Lua scripting in there or badness will happen.

Command functions are defined in the MeepBot.Commands table, like so:

MeepBot.Commands["foo"] = function( type, caller, params )
	MeepBot.Say( "foo" )
end

"type" is the type of incoming message (TYPE_MESSAGE, TYPE_PM, or TYPE_MOD_CHAT)
"caller" is a string with the username who called the command.
"params" is the argument string given after the command, or nil if blank.

Simple example to clarify the above:

[Fire_Adept] !say Die.	--> caller = "Fire_Adept", params = "Die."
[Fire_Adept] !fling	--> caller = "Fire_Adept", params = nil

Available MeepBot commands in Lua:

MeepBot.Say( msg )	- self explanatory.

MeepBot.Emote( msg )	- self explanatory.

MeepBot.PM( user, msg )	- self explanatory.

MeepBot.Rand( bound )	- gets a random number from MeepBot's PRNG in
	the range of 0 .. bound. If bound is not given, returns a random
	(unsigned) 32-bit number.

MeepBot.Resolve( caller, pattern )	- attempts to resolve a given name
	pattern using MeepBot's internal user list. If the pattern is "me",
	returns "caller"; otherwise, the closest unique match is returned,
	or "pattern" if no match is found.
